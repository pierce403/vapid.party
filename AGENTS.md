# Agent Guidelines for vapid.party

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Git hygiene (required)
- Always `git commit` and `git push` whenever you finish a discrete piece of work (after `npm run lint` / `npm run build` if relevant).

## Core practices
- Avoid pretend data: don’t display “sample” counts, quotas, or marketing stats unless they are backed by real logic/data. If something isn’t implemented, hide it or label it explicitly as a placeholder.
- Prefer truth over polish: if a value is unknown, render “—” or omit the UI instead of inventing a default that looks like real usage.
- Keep product surface honest: UI/README/API docs should not claim limits/metrics/features that the backend doesn’t enforce or record.

## Implementation notes
- If a UI element implies user data (e.g., “subscribers”), it must be computed from persisted data (DB) and named clearly (e.g., “subscriber count” vs “subscription limit”).
- Keep “demo/dev shortcuts” (mock auth, fixtures) clearly gated (env flag) and never shipped as the default behavior.

## Style and structure (per recurse.bot guidance)
- Keep instructions concise and actionable; prefer bullet points over long prose.
- Update this file when workflows, conventions, or sharp edges change.
- Avoid redundant/conflicting directives; add scoped AGENTS files only when necessary.

## Local workflows
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Tests: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`
- DB migrate: `npm run db:migrate`
